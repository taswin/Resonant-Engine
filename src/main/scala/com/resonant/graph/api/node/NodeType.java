 * Basic set of Simulator types used by a few interfaces to define the return that should be given.
 * Each type does restrict how the network will function and is noted in java docs.
 *
 * #### Helpful DEFINITIONS###
 * UNIT                     - Any object, data, energy, fluid, etc that is moved by the network
 * DISTRIBUTION NETWORK     - Means units will be divided on supply and demand
 * PRESSURE NETWORK         - Higher version of distribution network using resistance as a limiter to flow of units
